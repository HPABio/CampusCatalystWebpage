Yes — this time I **actually used the Luma page content** as the foundation (copy themes, event purpose, panel topic, speakers, venue, and registration flow), and expanded it into a full event-series website architecture.

Below is a structured plan for a **Campus Catalyst series website**, grounded in the Luma event page details ([luma.com][1]) and aligned with your internal series planning (5 events across 2025–2026) .

## Home Page Sections

### 1) Hero

* Title: **The Campus Catalyst**
* One-liner: a new event series to “supercharge the life science ecosystem in Southwest Germany” ([luma.com][1])
* Primary CTAs:

  * **Register for the next event**
  * **View the series timeline**
* Trust row (logos): Nucleate + hosting partners (align with “Presented by Nucleate Global Events Calendar” and hosts shown on Luma) ([luma.com][1])

### 2) Series Mission

Short narrative that mirrors the Luma promise:

* “Bridge and connect the region’s most innovative minds… bring together key stakeholders, visionary start-ups, and life science enthusiasts” ([luma.com][1])
  Plus your series goal of building Heidelberg’s visibility and ecosystem pull .

### 3) 5-Step Timeline (Event Series Journey)

A dedicated timeline block (visual cards with “Edition I–V”, month, theme, CTA).

Use the series cadence you defined (roughly every 2 months, moving along the startup/TRL journey) :

1. **Campus Catalyst I (Kickoff) — Oct/Nov 2025**
   Theme: *Ecosystem launch + founder/investor collaboration* (panel-led kickoff vibe from Luma) ([luma.com][1])
2. **Campus Catalyst II — Dec 2025**
   Theme: *From idea → validation (team, IP, first milestones)* 
3. **Campus Catalyst III — Apr 2026**
   Theme: *Translation & early company build (preclinical, partnerships)* 
4. **Campus Catalyst IV — Jul 2026**
   Theme: *Scaling & financing (VC expectations, growth)* 
5. **Campus Catalyst V — Oct 2026 (Big Splash)**
   Theme: *Flagship edition with expanded seats + top-tier speakers/VIP ecosystem pull* 

### 4) “Why Attend?” (Value Proposition)

Lift directly from Luma and turn into icon cards:

* Insights from pioneers on building/scaling biotech ventures ([luma.com][1])
* Connect with decision-makers, founders, researchers ([luma.com][1])
* Discover collaboration opportunities ([luma.com][1])
* Shape the future of life science in Southwest Germany ([luma.com][1])

### 5) Featured Session / Theme Highlight

From the Luma centerpiece:

* Panel spotlight: **“It takes a village…”** (collaboration needed to turn science into impact) ([luma.com][1])
  This becomes the rotating “feature” for each edition.

### 6) Speaker Highlights (Carousel)

For the kickoff edition, Luma lists the “industry heavyweights” and their roles (use on the homepage as featured speakers and link to full speaker profiles) ([luma.com][1]):

* Dr. Nicole Hecht (BioRN)
* Prof. Heinz Hänel (Oxy5 / ex-Sanofi; drug development achievements described)
* Edward Holson (Anavo Therapeutics, CSO)
* Ksenia Burka (Reactosome)
* Johanna Michielin (BioLabs, Regional Director Europe)

### 7) Venue / Location Block

* Venue: BioLabs Heidelberg, Heidelberg Innovation Park ([luma.com][1])
* Address: Nikola-Tesla-Straße 1, 69124 Heidelberg ([luma.com][1])
  Include map embed + transit/parking notes.

### 8) Registration Block (Series-level)

Make the registration flow explicit and frictionless:

* “Register for the next event” CTA
* Note if any editions use wallet/token verification (Luma mentions token ownership verification) ([luma.com][1])
* Newsletter signup (for people not ready to register)

### 9) Social Proof

* “42 attended the kickoff edition” (or “42 went”) as early traction proof ([luma.com][1])
* Optional: partner quotes / attendee testimonials (post-event)

### 10) Footer

Contact, partners, social links, imprint/privacy.

If you want, I can also turn this into **ready-to-build navigation + page wireframes** (section order, recommended CTAs, and what content you need to collect for each block), and align the copy tone tightly with the Luma page voice.
